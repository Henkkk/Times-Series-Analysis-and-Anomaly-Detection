# Introduction 
This is a project I've done during my time at Xccelerate immersive data science programme. We were asked to do an anomaly detection on a dataset given by our instructor (I've also uploaded it on Github). It's about the outbound utilization rate of one of the biggest telecom companies in the U.K, with timestamps provided.
